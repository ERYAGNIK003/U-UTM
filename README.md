# UAV-GSD
Derivation of Ground Sample Distance (GSD) for UAV-based road traffic analytics.

Training:
We uses empirical data points given in TrainingData.csv file to find relationship between cm/px and flight height. 

Testing: 
Run rmse.py to find RMSE error in GSD mapping for rotated UAV videos. We have tested empirical GSD on 3 different videos having varying flight height and rotation.
