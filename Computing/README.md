# Traffic density and computing time

We extracted vehicles' tracks using a tracking-by-detection approach from UAV videos with varying traffic densities (vehicles/frame) and measured inference time to verify the impact of traffic density on inference time.

Run computingTime.py to get statistics on computing time.
