# UAV-GSD
Derivation of Ground Sample Distance (GSD) for UAV-based road traffic analytics.

Training:
We uses empirical data points given in TrainingData.csv file to find relationship between cm/px and flight height. 

Testing: 
Run rmse.py to find RMSE error in GSD mapping for rotated UAV videos. We have tested empirical GSD on 3 different videos having varying flight height and rotation. 

Dataset Description:
Videos are available on following link [GSD mapping for UAV-based video analytics]: www.youtube.com/@YagnikBhavsar.

Owners: 
Yagnik M Bhavsar, Mazad S Zaveri, and Mehul S Raval [Ahmedabad University].
